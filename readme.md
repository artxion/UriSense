#                  🩺 **UriSense**
UriSense is a compact, IoT-enabled device designed to measure urinary calcium concentration using a turbidity-based optical method. It enables early detection of calcium-related diseases and offers a non-invasive, accessible way to monitor this critical health parameter — from the comfort of home or clinical settings.

## ✨ Features 
#### Turbidity-based Optical Sensing Custom-built sensor measures urinary calcium concentration by analyzing sample turbidity.

#### Early Disease Detection Helps monitor and identify conditions like:

* Kidney stones

* Hypercalciuria

* Other calcium-related disorders

#### 🌐 Custom IoT Platform Sensor data is securely stored on a custom-built IoT platform for:

* Real-time tracking

* Historical reference

* Future analysis

#### 👌 User-friendly & Non-invasive Compact design ensures ease of use and comfort without invasive procedures.

## ⚙️ How It Works 
#### 🧪 Sample Collection: 
A small urine sample is introduced into the sensor chamber.
#### 💡 Turbidity Measurement: 
The sensor emits light through the sample and measures light scattering to estimate calcium concentration. 
#### 🧮 Data Processing & Calibration: 
Sensor readings are processed and calibrated using predefined calibration curves to ensure accuracy. 
#### 📡 Data Transmission: 
The measured data is securely transmitted to the IoT platform via WiFi/Bluetooth. 
#### 📊 Analysis & Visualization: 
Users access historical trends and receive alerts/reports via a web/mobile dashboard.
